#react-router-pyramid

There are now three branches here:  "master", "pyramid" and "reactx"

#####  This is the "reactx" branch.

#####  NOTE:  This branch will use 'react-router-redux' to merger react-router w/ redux!!!

There are two remote repositories, one for each branch:

master =>   "origin"	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-app.git
pyramid =>  "pyr"   	https://github.com/rodstaff/react-router-pyramid.git
